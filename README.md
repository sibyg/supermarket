# QMetric Code Exercise
We value the ability to model problems in software, so our first assessment will be around that subject. The exercise is to model and code a simple supermarket pricing solution and it is inspired on [PragDave Supermaket Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/). 
 
Please read through the description carefully and implement a solution for it. We don't want you to over-engineer the solution but be prepared to extend the functionality in the next step of the interview process. 

Please create a local repository using git or and then commit locally. When you have finished please zip up the whole folder (including .git folder) and email to us (arodriguez@qmetric.co.uk) within 3 days. We will then review it within 2 days. We provide a project skeleton in Maven, but feel free to use whatever build tool you like (gradle, etc).

Good Luck!

## Things we value
* Working software!
* Tests
* A working build
* Small checkins with good comments
* Put your notes in NOTES.md (maybe talk about trade offs and design decisions)
* Simple code (but not necessarily easy!)
* The less libraries the better, we want to see your code but if you want to use X then say why in your readme.
* We value good domain names and modelling
* Immutability 

## Things to expect
* If you get to the next stage we will pair on your code
* We will add some more features
* Maybe refactor some things
* Be prepared to talk about your code
* Understand alternatives of design decisions


# The Problem

## Description
You have the task to write a component that can calculate the total amount to pay for a supermarket basket.
Products are sold by unit or weight, for example 1 coke or 0.450kg of oranges.
The supermarket also wants to provide discounts on certain item combinations, for example:
- Three cans of beans for the price of two.
- Two cans of Coke, for £1.

## Example
Use the following example of a receipt to know what data needs to be available. **There's no requirement to format or print a receipt**.

    Beans                0.50
    Beans                0.50
    Beans                0.50
    Coke                 0.70
    Coke                 0.70
    Oranges
    0.200 kg @  £1.99/kg 0.40
                        -----
    Sub-total            3.30

    Savings
    Beans 3 for 2       -0.50
    Coke 2 for £1       -0.40
                        -----
    Total savings       -0.90
    -------------------------
    Total to Pay         2.40
